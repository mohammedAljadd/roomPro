# Ongoing Web Application Project: RoomPro

## Project Overview

RoomPro is a web application that simplifies room booking and management. Built with `Spring Boot` for the backend and `Angular` for the frontend, it follows a clean architecture that separates concerns into Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Entities for scalability and maintainability.

Entities represent the core data structures of the application. These classes are annotated with JPA annotations to map them to database tables.


- `Users` : Represents users of the system, such as admin or regular users.

- `Role` :  Defines the roles available in the system, such as Admin and User. 

- `UserPrincipal` : Represents the principal (authenticated user) in the system. This entity typically holds the user details (such as username, password, roles) that are needed for authentication and authorization.


- `Booking` : Represents a booking made by a user for a specific room. 


- `Room` : Represents a room in the system. 


- `Equipment` : Represents the various equipment available for rooms. 


- `RoomEquipmentMapping` : Represents the mapping of equipment to rooms. It shows which equipment is available in which room.


- `CleaningType` : Defines various types of cleaning tasks, such as daily, weekly, and on-demand cleaning.

- `CleaningAfterUse` : Represents a specific cleaning task that occurs after a room is used, typically when the room is vacated.

- `CleaningWeekly` : Represents cleaning tasks that occur on a weekly schedule. 

- `RoomCleaningAssignment` : Represents the assignment of cleaning tasks to specific rooms. 


- `Maintenance` : Represents scheduled maintenance tasks for rooms.
