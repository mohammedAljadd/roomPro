# Ongoing Web Application Project: RoomPro

## Project Overview

RoomPro is a web application that simplifies room booking and management. Built with `Spring Boot` for the backend and `Angular` for the frontend, it follows a clean architecture that separates concerns into Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Entities for scalability and maintainability. The app securely stores user and room data in a relational database.

## Project Architecture

### 1. Entities

Entities represent the core data structures of the application. These classes are annotated with JPA annotations to map them to database tables.


- `Users` : Represents users of the system, such as admin or regular users.

- `Role` :  Defines the roles available in the system, such as Admin and User. 

- `UserPrincipal` : Represents the principal (authenticated user) in the system. This entity typically holds the user details (such as username, password, roles) that are needed for authentication and authorization.


- `Booking` : Represents a booking made by a user for a specific room. 


- `Room` : Represents a room in the system. 


- `Equipment` : Represents the various equipment available for rooms. 


- `RoomEquipmentMapping` : Represents the mapping of equipment to rooms. It shows which equipment is available in which room.


- `CleaningType` : Defines various types of cleaning tasks, such as daily, weekly, and on-demand cleaning.

- `CleaningAfterUse` : Represents a specific cleaning task that occurs after a room is used, typically when the room is vacated.

- `CleaningWeekly` : Represents cleaning tasks that occur on a weekly schedule. 

- `RoomCleaningAssignment` : Represents the assignment of cleaning tasks to specific rooms. 


- `Maintenance` : Represents scheduled maintenance tasks for rooms.
